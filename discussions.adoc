== Picking Up a Language or Framework
When you're just starting off, learning to code might seem a bit overwhelming. There are dozens of programming languages and coding frameworks out there for you to choose from; all of them have similarities, and differences that make them unique. Programmers often select just one programming language or framework to help them meet their goals. If you're reading this, it's likely that you've got some goals of your own! Use the following flow-chart diagram to help you pick the right tool for your needs. When you've reached a terminal in the diagram (i.e. the end of the path), click on the programming language to learn more about it.
