== Introduction
Welcome to the LearnTeachCode Code & Coffee Compendium! Maintained by the Baldwin Park & El Sereno/Alhambra study group, this page serves as a resource compendium for facilitating frequently asked questions of the form "Where should I go to learn <insert computer science topic>" at our meetup events. If you have any requests for particular resources, or would like to add one, please feel free to submit a https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/code-coffee-compendium/issues/new[new issue] or create a https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork[pull request]!

This page was generated using https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] - a static-site generator for the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference[AsciiDoc] markup language.

== Picking Up a Language or Framework
When you're just starting off, learning to code might seem a bit overwhelming. There are dozens of programming languages and coding frameworks out there for you to choose from; all of them have similarities, and differences that make them unique. Programmers often select just one programming language or framework to help them meet their goals. If you're reading this, it's likely that you've got some goals of your own! Use the following flow-chart diagram to help you pick the right tool for your needs. When you've reached a terminal in the diagram (i.e. the end of the path), click on the programming language to learn more about it.

|Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. Source: Wikipedia.org

|JavaScript is a high-level programming language. It was originally designed as a scripting language for websites but became widely adopted as a general-purpose programming language, and is currently the most popular programming language in use. JavaScript is usually found running in a web browser as interactive or automated content, ranging from popup messages and live clocks to large web applications. JavaScript is also commonly used in server-side programming through platforms like Node.js[2], or "embedded" in non-JavaScript applications where the base programming language lacks the high-level functionality that JavaScript offers.

|Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan. Ruby is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Source: Wikipedia.org

|Unity is a type of game engine that was developed by a video game development company called Unity Technologies. The Unity engine allows developers to make both 2D and 3D games.  It currently supports only the C# programming language. It supports Direct3D, OpenGL, OpenGL ES, Metal, Vulkan, and proprietary API. Since 2016, Unity offers services on the cloud.

|Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, Linux, and z/OS. Swift is designed to work with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks and the large body of existing Objective-C code written for Apple products. Source: Wikipedia.org

An open-source product of more than twenty years of cutting-edge research, it allows rapid development of robust, concise, correct software. With strong support for integration with other languages, built-in concurrency and parallelism, debuggers, profilers, rich libraries and an active community, Haskell makes it easier to produce flexible, maintainable, high-quality software.

|Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework, which follows the model-template-view (MTV) architectural pattern. Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. The framework emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself. Source: Wikipedia.org

[#nodejs]
== image:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Node.js_logo.svg/1200px-Node.js_logo.svg.png[title="Node JS Logo", 200, 200]
|Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts.

[#react]
== image:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/React-icon.svg/1200px-React-icon.svg.png[title="React Logo", 200, 200]
|React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for state management and routing. Redux and React Router are respective examples of such libraries. Source: Wikipedia.org
